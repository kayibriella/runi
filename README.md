### 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses Convex as its backend database with the following key tables:

**Core Business Tables:**
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `products` - Product inventory with box/kg tracking
- `productcategory` - Product categories
- `sales` - Sales transactions with detailed tracking
- `sales_audit` - Audit trail for sales transactions
- `expenses` - Business expenses with categorization
- `expensecategory` - Expense categories
- `documents` - File storage metadata
- `folders` - Document organization
- `files` - Individual file records

**Tracking & Monitoring Tables:**
- `restock` - New inventory additions
- `stock_corrections` - Inventory adjustments
- `damaged_products` - Damaged inventory tracking
- `stock_movements` - All inventory movements (also used for product deletion approval workflow)

#### Product Editing and Deletion Approval Workflow

The application implements a two-phase approval workflow for product edits and deletions to prevent accidental data loss:

1. **Edit Request Phase**:
   - User selects a product to edit in the inventory interface
   - System opens the "Edit Product" dialog
   - User modifies one or more fields and provides a reason for the changes
   - Upon submission, for each changed field, a record is created in the `stock_movements` table with:
     - `movement_type`: 'product_edit'
     - `product_id`: References the product being edited
     - `field_changed`: The specific field that was modified
     - `old_value`: Original value before edit
     - `new_value`: Proposed new value
     - `reason`: User-provided explanation
     - `status`: Initially 'pending'
     - `performed_by`: User who initiated the edit

2. **Deletion Request Phase**:
   - User selects a product to delete in the inventory interface
   - System opens the "Request Product Deletion" dialog
   - User must provide a reason for the deletion
   - Upon submission, a record is created in the `stock_movements` table with:
     - `movement_type`: 'product_delete'
     - `product_id`: References the product to be deleted
     - `reason`: User-provided reason for deletion
     - `status`: Initially 'pending'
     - `performed_by`: User who initiated the request

3. **Approval Phase**:
   - Pending edit and deletion requests appear in the "Stock Adjustment" view
   - Managers can either:
     - **Approve**: Applies the changes to the actual product (for edits) or permanently deletes the product (for deletions)
     - **Reject**: Cancels the request, keeping the product unchanged

#### Sales Table Structure

The `sales` table contains the following fields:
- `sales_id` - Unique identifier for the sale
- `user_id` - Reference to the user who owns this record
- `product_id` - Reference to the product being sold
- `boxes_quantity` - Number of boxes sold
- `kg_quantity` - Weight in kilograms sold
- `box_price` - Price per box
- `kg_price` - Price per kilogram
- `profit_per_box` - Profit margin per box
- `profit_per_kg` - Profit margin per kilogram
- `total_amount` - Total sale value
- `amount_paid` - Amount already paid by customer
- `remaining_amount` - Outstanding balance
- `payment_status` - Current payment status (pending/partial/completed)
- `payment_method` - Method of payment used
- `performed_by` - User who executed the sale
- `client_id` - Reference to the customer
- `client_name` - Customer name
- `phone_number` - Customer contact number
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of last modification

#### Sales Audit Table Structure

The `sales_audit` table tracks all changes to sales records:
- `audit_id` - Unique identifier for the audit record
- `user_id` - Reference to the user who owns this record
- `sales_id` - Reference to the sales record being audited
- `audit_type` - Type of change (insert/update/delete)
- `boxes_change` - Changes to box quantities (before/after values)
- `kg_change` - Changes to kg quantities (before/after values)
- `old_values` - Complete previous state of the record
- `new_values` - Complete new state of the record
- `performed_by` - User who made the change
- `approval_status` - Current approval status (pending/approved/rejected)
- `approved_by` - User who approved the change (if applicable)
- `approved_timestamp` - When the change was approved (if applicable)
- `reason` - Explanation for the audit action
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of the audit record creation

Each table is designed with appropriate indexes for optimal query performance and includes timestamp fields for audit trails. The `stock_movements` table is particularly important as it not only tracks all inventory movements but also manages both product editing and deletion approval workflows. For edit requests, it includes a `field_changed` column to track which specific field is being modified.

## 🔄 Routing Implementation

The application now features a complete client-side routing system that enables direct URL access to all modules:

1. **BrowserRouter Integration**: The main application is wrapped with React Router's BrowserRouter in `main.tsx`
2. **Route Configuration**: Dynamic routes are configured in `App.tsx` to handle module parameters
3. **Parameter-Based Navigation**: The `BusinessDashboard.tsx` component uses `useParams` to read URL parameters and `useNavigate` for programmatic navigation
4. **Validation & Fallback**: Invalid module URLs are automatically redirected to the home page
5. **State Synchronization**: URL changes are synchronized with application state for consistent UI

This implementation ensures users can bookmark, share, and directly access any module while maintaining the existing application functionality.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Convex**
   This project uses Convex for the backend. You need to set up your Convex project and environment variables.

   Run the dev command to initialize:
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```
   
   - If this is your first time, it will prompt you to log in to Convex.
   - You will be asked to select an existing project or create a new one.
   - This process will automatically generate a `.env.local` file with your `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `VITE_CONVEX_URL`.

   **Note:** If you are using authentication providers (like GitHub, Google, etc.), you will need to configure them in the [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) and add any required environment variables.

4. **Start the development server**
   This command runs both the frontend (Vite) and backend (Convex) concurrently.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Convex Dashboard: Automatically opens or runs in the background

### Build for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## 📜 Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts both frontend and backend in development mode with proper routing.
- `npm run dev:frontend`: Starts only the Vite frontend server with routing enabled.
- `npm run dev:backend`: Starts only the Convex backend server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm run lint`: Runs type checking and linting.

## 🔒 Authentication

This project uses `@convex-dev/auth` for handling user authentication. Ensure you have configured your Convex project correctly to handle auth providers if needed.
